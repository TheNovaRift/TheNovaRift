- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheNovaRift
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of video games.  I have recently taken to Cozy games but I truly love games that allow you to be the character in all aspect.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a Game Developer by attending Full Sail University.  I was attending there as a Cinematography major but recently decided its not for me, I need to create games!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can further my knowledge!
- 📫 How to reach me email or Twitter are the easiest ways!  novarift@gmail.com @novarift
